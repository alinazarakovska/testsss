<h1><em>Opportunities in our school.<em></h1>  
<div>
<p><em>// 
<br> In our school there are a lot of opportunities for our students.
<br> Every student can find suitable lessons, and our school is always open for new ideas, so if there are any interesting offers that you want to do, you can always tell your ideas and every idea will be heard and then we will tink about how we can do that. 
<br> We believe that school is not the place where the student just has to sit from 8.00-15.00pm and torment while waiting for the last lessons end. 
<br>Our students like to come to school and are happy to organize various events after school, most of our school projects were made up by students. 
<br> We believe that school can be a place where students can express themselves the way the want to.</em> </p>

<h2> Art </h2>
<p> <i>// Drawing is a great way to express yourself. In the process of drawing, a person learns himself, his possibilities and can fully discover his personal potential.
 </p> <div>
<p>Drawing helps to develop cognitive function. You improve visual memory, visual perception of objects, fine motor skills. You will be able to look around with a special wider view. All things will seem different, especially the perfect creatures of nature will begin to surprise when, when drawing, you begin to notice unique and harmonious images around. Drawing is another way to explore the world! </p> 
</div> 
<div> <p> That is why our school has an Art club that gives students the opportunity to practice and express themselves. </p> </div>

<h2>Choir</h2>
<p> <i>// Of course, our students also has an opportunity to do more than just science, sports or arts -  but also singing. Our school has a choir where any student can apply. </p>
<div> <p> Why that is necessary? First, the choir gives a person a sense of happiness. We can say that choral singing has a pronounced psychotherapeutic effect. The singing person knows how to relax, is less susceptible to stress and has a better ability to concentrate. .</p> </div>
